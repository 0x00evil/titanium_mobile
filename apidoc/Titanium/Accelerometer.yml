  The top level Accelerometer module.  The Accelerometer modules contains \
  methods and properties for using the device accelerometer.

events:
    - name: update
      description: fired when the accelerometer changes
      properties:
            - x: the x axis of the device
            - y: the y axis of the device
            - z: the z axis of the device
            - timestamp: |
                Reference timestamp since the previous change. this is
                not a valid timestamp and should simply be used to determine
                the time between events and not an exact timestamp.

since: 0.8.5 or earlier

      Adds an accelerometer update event listener which prints out
      the x, y and z axis as the device is moved.  You should generally
      remove the event when not used to conserve device 
      resources.  If you do not have an active event listener, the 
      accelerometer is turned off to conserve device resources.
      <code>
      	Titanium.Accelerometer.addEventListener('update',function(e)
      	{
      		Ti.API.debug("accelerometer - x:"+e.x+",y:"+e.y+",z:"+e.z);
      	});
      </code>
